   Master Branch 
   * All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis - Completed
   * Some code to complete the machine learning portion of the porject - Completed 
   
   README.md
   * Description of the communication protocols - Established
   * Outline of the project - Completed
   * 8 Commits in total - Completed
   
   
   ### Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model

   * Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database
      - Output labels for input data
   ### Preliminary Data Preprocessing
   - To convert our categorical variable data into indicator variables of 0 or 1, we used panda's .get_dummies
   - Preprocessing on our calculated columns which serve as our selected features such as Debt-to-Asset ratio and Net Profit Margin, had to be done before they   
     could be introduced into our model.
    - any N/A's, or infinite values had to be removed
   ### Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
   #### *Target Features - Three Month Return & First Day Return
   
   List of Features
   
   | Features Category  | Feature | Description & Reason for Selection | 
   | :--- | :--- |:--- |
   | **Categorical** | **Industry & Sector**| The market's receptiveness of each IPO will never be the same each issuance. It will differ largely based onthe Sector and Industry of the company. | 
   | **Operational Performance** | **EBITDA** | earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company's overall financial performance before the influence of accounting and financial deductions.  |
   | **Operational Financial Performance** | **Gross Profit Margin** | A measure of profitability that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. |
   | **Operational Financial Performance**| **Net Profit Margin**| It is the percentage of sales remaining after all expenses, interest, taxes and preferred stock dividends have been deducted from total revenue. |
   | **Operational Financial Performance**| **Operating Cash Flow** | It is a measure of the amount of cash generated by a company's normal business operations. It indicates whether a company can generate sufficient positive cash flow to maintain and grow its operations. | 
   | **Financial Health Indication** | **Debt Asset Ratio**| A leverage ratio that defines the total amount of debt relative to assets owned by the company.|
   | **Financial Health Indication**|**Current Ratio**| A liquidity metric that measures the company's ability to pay off its short term financial obligations in one year|
   | **Long-term Planning**|**Research & Development (R&D)**| This is the amount of expenses in which the company devotes into developing or enhancing new products and services.|
   | **Long-term Planning**| **Cash Flow from Investment**| How much cash has been generated or spent from various investment-related activities in a specific period. Investing activities include purchases of physical assets, investments in R&D, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets.|

  #### Preliminary Data Preprocessing
   - To convert our categorical variable data into indicator variables of 0 or 1, we used panda's .get_dummies
   - Preprocessing on our calculated columns which serve as our selected features such as Debt-to-Asset ratio and Net Profit Margin, had to be done before they   
     could be introduced into our model.
    - any N/A's, or infinite values had to be removed
  #### Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
  -  Potential features we decided to include and test since these are relevant KPIs/ Business metrics to determine company performance which could influence a company's stock price
  - Net Profit Margin
       - This is the percentage of total profit over total sales made by the company. It is the percentage of sales remaining after all expenses, interest, taxes and preferred stock dividends have been deducted from total revenue.
        - Indicates the company's ability to bring money from its regular operations
- Gross Margin
	- The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company retains on each dollar of sales
- Debt Asset Ratio
        - A leverage ratio that defines the total amount of debt relative to assets owned by the company
	- In other words, it shows the degree to which a company has used debt to finance its assets.
	- For shareholders, this is a good indicator of how a company's assets are financed; Whether the bulk of assets are financed by the shareholders vs. creditors
	
- Current Ratio
        - This is a financial KPI that measure the company's ability to pay off its short term financial obligations in one year.

#### Model Choice
- Since we have labeled data, we've tried using a variety of different binary classification models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machine - SVM  
    - Deep Learning
- Our most successful results so far - with introducing just debt-to-asset ratio with Sector/Industry and a target feature of three month price grain/increase:

#### Deep Learning

#### To be attempted

- Explore sector specific features
    - there are many different features at which people would value certain companies  more depending on the specific 
    - different businesses have could have differenent emphasis on different metrics
    - ie. manufacturing KPI vs merchandising KPI
- Training/testing:
    - training data on pre 2019 data
    - testing on 2020 data
- Other Featrues to test:
    - Total Sales Revenue
    - Total Net Profit
    - EBITDA
